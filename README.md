Randomizer
Randomizer redirects the user (i.e., the web browser) to a random URL from a custom list of URLs.

Randomizer is built with the intent of randomization in a controlled experiment.

For now, there is only a HTML file with JavaScript. But more languages are hopefully supported later.

Example Usage
For example, create three Google Docs forms (or equivalent) and add their URLs to the list in the file. That's it!

The user is then automatically and randomly assigned to one of the URLs when the user visits this file. If the user decides to close and reopen the browser, the user is still redirected to the same URL since a cookie is saved in the web browser.
